## BRIEF
The SEAL Team 8 message has been successfully decoded and we have learned that the entire, "Dark Eyes", physical infrastructure is designed solely with MicroPython and the specific hardware of choice is the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller which contain the frozen MicroPython bytecode within the .elf and .uf2 firmware images that Dr. Rinn and her team has developed.

Natalia Agapov, a "Dark Eyes" Infrastructure Engineer, sympathetic to the extensive damage the SolarWinds hacks have done around the world decided to use her burner phone to capture a screen-shot of a collection of hand-written post-it notes outside Dr. Rinn's private study.

She then went direclty to the one and only way in or out of the elaborate compound which is located at Gate 1337 to which she escaped the "Dark Eyes" underground compound and managed to make her way to Vladivostok, Russia by means of the Trans-Siberian Railway where she came across the Internet-Magazin where she found a hardwired laptop inside what appeared to be an abandoned building.

She was able to download the Tor Browser and successfully navigate to emailondeck.com where she created a temp e-mail address and reach out to the "Five Eyes" HQ, Pine Gap, in Alice Springs, Australia along with her physical coordinates in the hopes she might be rescued out of Russia to which she would hand off her burner phone with the image and her usb drive containing the .elf and .uf2 firmware of the 1337 Gate firmware.

Bets Fielding was tasked with sneaking on board the DBS Cruise Ferry which was now used for cargo shipments after the Covid pandemic.  Her mission was to find Natalia and bring her safely back to Sakaiminato, Japan where she would get her a new identity with the help of the allied forces.

When Bets arrived back to Northern Virginia she and her team met in their newly constructed classified field office to begin reverse engineering the .elf binary.  They successfully extracted the capture.png containing Natalia's screenshot of Dr. Rinn's hand-written notes in addition to a copy of the Gate 1337 firmware in both .elf and .uf2 formats as well as a bc0.h file which they were unsure of its purpose.

They flashed the .uf2 on a Raspberry Pi Pico to see how specifically the firmware operated in addition to running a string analysis on it to which was unsuccessful as all of the relevant strings were encrypted with the world's most advanced enctryption referred to as the Rinn Encryption.

Bets also reviewed the QSTR MicroPython Documentation to get familiar with how MicroPython handled strings located at https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/develop/qstr.html.

## MISSION
You have been selected by the DC540 ANGELS OF DEATH to be the Reverse Engineer on this mission.  Your task is to review the attached capture.png and bc0.h to find clues of where to being reverse engineering the .elf binary.   and report back to Field Marshall Fortune with your results by sending a private Discord DM to @dc540baab.

## HINT
"Sometimes it takes a bombe to break encryption!"
