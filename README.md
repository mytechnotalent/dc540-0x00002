## BRIEF
The SEAL Team 8 message has been successfully decoded and we have learned that the entire, "Dark Eyes", physical infrastructure is designed solely with MicroPython and the specific hardware of choice is the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller which contain the frozen MicroPython bytecode within the .elf and .uf2 firmware images that Dr. Rinn and her team has developed.





<br>

## MISSION
You have been selected by the DC540 ANGELS OF DEATH to be the Reverse Engineer on this mission.  The first task is to decrypt this strange message to which SEAL Team 8 found and report back to Field Marshall Fortune with your results by sending a private Discord DM to @dc540baab.

## HINT
